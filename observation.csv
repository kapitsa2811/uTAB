3 /3/2018,INPUT,OUTPUT,COMMENT,
,gov IMAGES nearly 10000,GOV logo got green,,
,Some images were nlank with white background,,,
,segmented images were green,succesfully done,For GOV as well as other symbol making it green wa succesfull,
,,,Data contains presence as well as absence of symbol we want to make green and it was successfull,
,,,Next task is to segment multiple symbol,
,,,,
,When tried for other GOV images from open domain ie which were not used +AFw-, The results are moved to dropbox result(another copy),,
,for training results are good but still there is scope for improvement,,+ACI- y0s.jpg is 20 epoch copy, y0s1.jpg is 50 epoch copy+ACI-
,,,By comparing 20 to 50 epoch it seems more training degrading results as well as increasing falls positives,
,,,,
,from previous observation of poor results by increasing +ACM- of epoch,,,
,It seems it perform bad for color images and not so next experiment can be giving test images in gray format,,,
,,,,
,,,,
,With multiple GOI images cant say result is improving,The reults moved to dropbox Allresults folder all oher results are kept there,,
,,,,
,+ACI-reapeted experiment with 1000, 10000 images with tables.+ACI-,,
,Table images were fixed.,results are encouraging but it is not able to segment entire table as expected.,,
,+ACI-trained for 100, 500 epochs+ACI-,resuts show no improvement in 500 epechs,
,,500 epochs results are uploaded to dropbox,,
,,,,
8 .5.2018,Now Unet was used to segment tables,It fails to segment tables,Making changes in data generation process ,
,,,Instead of giving all elelments in segment images only tables can be given,
,Weekly supervised approach also failed .,,xperimenting it with green and black images,
27.5.2018,,,,
,,,Or Unet no of nodes can be increased Need to study original problem for which Unet code was developed,
,,,,
,,,,
,+ACI-Tryied masking techniques in which segmented tables were totally black, and nothing else was present.+ACI-,ImageDataCreation5+AF8-.py  used to generate masked tables.,+ACI-This was inspired from paper +ACIAIg-saliency based CNN for table and chart detection+ACIAIg-+ACI-
,This failed to segment tables and experiment was running for 132 epochs.,,vgg16 can be tried for segmentation,
,,,,
,Now aim become to reconstruct original results in which only table images were made green,ImageDataCreation4+AF8-.py  used to generate weakly supervised data,Pipe segmentation approach also need to try,
,,ImageDataCreation+AF8-3.py is used to generate segtables,,
,,,,
,,,,
,segmentation Experiment master contains code for rectangle and circle,,,
,,,,
,,,,
15.6.2018,+ACI-Tables were made white and background black, resuls are stored in resultsBlack.+ACI-,+ACI-results are encouraging, It is showing some +- sign for different data which not present in training data. But it is missing some tables in generated data.+ACI-
,,,,
,,Next step is ti try to segment characters,,
,,,,
,,,,
18.6.2018,Character segmentation is attempted. 1st time got very meaningful results.,+ACI-minor flaws were there , output was not having proper length and width which is now corrected+ACI-,
,Data was generated by code generateFiles.py which is in dataGenerationImage project,results were present in resultsOne,,
,,,,
20.6.2018,+ACI-Got very nice results for character segmentation task, +ACI-,,
23.6.2018s,+ACI-SOME JUNK character are inserted in meaningful characters, Now the segment Image is word level segmented Image+ACI-,next task is to include table level data and refine results got in this task,
,previously it was line level segmentes Expected results contains word level segmentation emitting junk chars,+ACI-make model results reproducible, also to prove filtring capability of model+ACI-,
,code used for it is generateFiles+AF8-1.py for data generation,Final will be to implement these methods on publication datasets,,
,,,,
,,,,
,,Making my model with small no of nodes using VGG16 or other weights in it and make it publishable,,
,1st attempt was not fully succesfull it only shows word levels segmentation it was not able to separate between words and lines,,,
,It may be becuase there were no lines in training set,,,
,,,,
,New smaller network is designed in short only layers containing maxpooling are kept,results r not that bad takes little time so can get idea how results are going to come validation loss is 0.30 best,,
,in results table lines in character are getting segmented as block part of line away from character is removed,,,
,Tables having space with words are getting properly segmented,,,
,New training data with edges is generated,results are partially good it is emitting lines but for refinment denser network is necessary,,
